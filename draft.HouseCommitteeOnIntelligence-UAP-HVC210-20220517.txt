We will now turn to the business of this hearing.
More than fifty years ago the U.S. government ended Project BLUE BOOK-- an effort to catalog and understand sightings of objects in the air that could not otherwise be explained.
For more than twenty years that project has treated unidentified anomalies in our airspace as a national security threat to be monitored and investigated.
In 2017 we learned for the first time that the Department of Defense had quietly started restarted a similar organization tracking what we now call Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon or UAPs.
* Last year Congress rewrote the charter for that organization now called the Airborne Object Identification And Management Synchronization Group or AIMSOG for short.
Today we will bring that organization out of the shadows.
This hearing and oversite work has a simple idea at its core.
Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon are a potential national security threat and they need to be treated that way.
For too long the stigma associated with UAPs has gotten in the way of good intelligence analysis.
Pilots avoided reporting or were laughed at when they did.
DOD officials relegated the issue to the backroom or swept it under the rug entirely fearful of a sceptical national security community.
Today we know better.
UAPs are unexplained; It's true.
But they are real.
They need to be investigated and any threats they pose need to be mitigated.
Under Secretary Multrie, Mr. Brey, thank you for coming today.
First we need you to update us on the status of AIMSOG.
The legistlation creating it was passed in December;
The deadline for implementation is fast approaching.
But the group does not even have a named Director.
We need to know, sirs, the status of the organization and any obstacle to getting it up and running.
Secondly, you have to convince the audience today, and most especially the military and civilian aviators, the culture has changed: that those who report UAPs will be treated as witnesses, not as cooks.
Thirdly, you need to show us, Congress, and the American public whose imaginations you've captured, you are willing to follow the facts where they lead.
* You know we fear sometimes that the DOD is focused more on emphasizing what it can explain, not investigating what it can.
Looking for you to assure us today that all conclusions are on the table.
One final note: we are mindful today that AIMSOG is not starting from scratch.
This is the third version of this task force in DOD.
And civil society groups like Mutual UFO Network-- Mr. Corbel and others-- have been collecting data on this issue for years.
I hope you'll explain how you can leverage the knowledge and experience of our prior work on this matter to move the AIMSOG along.
The last time Congress had a hearing on UAPs was half a century ago.
I hope that it does not take fifty more years for Congress to hold another because transparency is desperately needed.
I now turn to ranking member Crawford for comments he'd like to make.
